    <h1><a href="The Raven.">The Raven.</a></h1>

    <div class="wrapper">
      <p>ONCE upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</p>
      <p>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,</p>
      <p>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</p>
      <p>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</p>
      <p>“ ‘Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door —</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Only this, and nothing more.”</p>
      <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,</p>
      <p>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</p>
      <p>Eagerly I wished the morrow; — vainly I had sought to borrow</p>
      <p>From my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost Lenore —</p>
      <p>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore —</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Nameless here for evermore.</p>
      <p>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</p>
      <p>Thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</p>
      <p>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</p>
      <p>“ ’Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door —</p>
      <p>Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; —</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">This it is, and nothing more.”</p>
      <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</p>
      <p>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</p>
      <p>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</p>
      <p>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</p>
      <p>That I scarce was sure I heard you” — here I opened wide the door; —</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Darkness there, and nothing more.</p>
      <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</p>
      <p>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</p>
      <p>But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,</p>
      <p>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”</p>
      <p>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Merely this, and nothing more.</p>
      <p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</p>
      <p>Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.</p>
      <p>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;</p>
      <p>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore —</p>
      <p>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; —</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">‘Tis the wind and nothing more!”</p>
      <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</p>
      <p>In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;</p>
      <p>Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;</p>
      <p>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door —</p>
      <p>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door —</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
      <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,</p>
      <p>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</p>
      <p>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,</p>
      <p>Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore —</p>
      <p>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
      <p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</p>
      <p>Though its answer little meaning — little relevancy bore;</p>
      <p>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</p>
      <p>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door —</p>
      <p>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">With such name as “Nevermore.”</p>
      <p>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</p>
      <p>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</p>
      <p>Nothing farther then he uttered — not a feather then he fluttered —</p>
      <p>Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before —</p>
      <p>On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.” </p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</p>
      <p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</p>
      <p>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store</p>
      <p>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</p>
      <p>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore —</p>
      <p>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Of “Never — nevermore.”</p>
      <p>But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,</p>
      <p>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;</p>
      <p>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</p>
      <p>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore —</p>
      <p>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</p>
      <p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</p>
      <p>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;</p>
      <p>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</p>
      <p>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplight [[lamp-light]] gloated o’er,</p>
      <p>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight [[lamp-light]] gloating o’er,</p>
      <p class="end-stanza"><i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>
      <p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</p>
      <p>Swung by angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</p>
      <p>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee — by these angels he hath sent thee</p>
      <p>Respite — respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!</p>
      <p>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
      <p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! — prophet still, if bird or devil! —</p>
      <p>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</p>
      <p>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted —</p>
      <p>On this home by Horror haunted — tell me truly, I implore —</p>
      <p><i>Is</i> there — is there balm in Gilead? — tell me — tell me, I implore!”</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
      <p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil — prophet still, if bird or devil!</p>
      <p>By that Heaven that bends above us — by that God we both adore —</p>
      <p>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</p>
      <p>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore —</p>
      <p>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
      <p>“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting —</p>
      <p>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!</p>
      <p>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</p>
      <p>Leave my loneliness unbroken! — quit the bust above my door!</p>
      <p>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
      <p>And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</p>
      <p>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;</p>
      <p>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,</p>
      <p>And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</p>
      <p>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</p>
      <p class="end-stanza">Shall be lifted — nevermore!</p>
