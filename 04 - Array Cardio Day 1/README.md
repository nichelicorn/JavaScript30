#### Goals
* Practice using array methods

#### Tidbits
* using ternary statements can eliminate several lines of code
  * don't use ternary statements if it makes the code harder to read / understand
* `arr.reduce()` can is used to return a new data object with some kind of accumulation of values / information from the original data
