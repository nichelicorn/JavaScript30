# JavaScript30 no. 17 - Sorting alphabetically, but leaving off the tiny words :)

[Sort the list! ðŸ‘»](https://codepen.io/nichelicorn/pen/NWvqxEO)

#### Goals
* Work with `Array.prototoype.sort()` to sort an array of data
  * Remove articles from the band names to sort alphabetically (ex. The Square Roots should be with the Ss, not the Ts)
* Display sorted list in the window

#### What did I learn?
* Sorting algorithms can contain variables and multiple conditions
