[Creepy shadows ðŸ‘»](https://codepen.io/nichelicorn/pen/MWvWzKV)

#### Goals
* Mouse move causes shadow tracking effect
* Can work with accelerometer for mobile effect

#### What did I learn?
* Use JS to manipulate styles and create animation effects
* This was fun! Simple math can create positional variables that allow animation effects to be created using CSS
