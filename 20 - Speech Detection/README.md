# JavaScript30 no. 20 - Speech Detection

*This project requires a local server - download the repo to run locally üôÉ*

#### Goals
* ‚úÖ Set up speech recognition in the browser
* Add error handling for unsupported browsers - revisit this - not sure how to set up feature detection

#### What did I learn?
* `SpeechRecognition` is a global variable that lives on top of the window object
  * ‚õîÔ∏è This is an experimental technology, and is *not* supported in Firefox, Opera, or Internet Explorer
  * Will need to convert to an array or use `for ... of` to iterate through the resultes 
  * There is SO MUCH data in these speech objects
<!-- ‚ú® Feature queries test browser support of CSS features -->
<!-- * Feature queries provide a way to test browser support of a certain feature -->
  <!-- * Similar to a media query, they check the browser envnironment for a conditon and run a block of rules if the conition is true -->
* I couldn't figure out how to add error handling on this round ... will revisit at the end of the 30!
