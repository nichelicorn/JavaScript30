# JavaScript30 no. 5 - Flex Panels Image Gallery

<!-- Practice with JavaScript array methods - the "gateway drug to functional programming" -->

<!-- [Check out the results on CodePen!](https://codepen.io/nichelicorn/pen/NWgjENe) -->

#### Goals
* Update layout using FlexBox
* Animate image panels to expand with user input

#### What did I learn?
* An item in CSS can both be a `flex item` as well as a `flex container`
* don't have to specify a width when using a `flex: num` property
