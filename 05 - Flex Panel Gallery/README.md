[See the gallery on CodePen!](https://codepen.io/nichelicorn/pen/rNwzWJq)

#### Goals
* Update layout using FlexBox
* Animate image panels to expand with user input

#### What did I learn?
* An element in CSS can both be a `flex item` as well as a `flex container`, meaning it can be itself flexed, *and* contain items to be flexed.
* don't have to specify a width when using a `flex: num` property - the `num` will indicate how much space the element should take up in a page; using `flex: 1` indicates each element should take up an equal amount of space on the page
* Practice reading / understanding CSS [selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)
* Don't spend too much time on content when you're working on code!
