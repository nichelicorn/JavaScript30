# JavaScript30 no. 7 - Array Workout 2

More practice with array methods!

[There is code to visit on CodePen!]()

#### Goals
* Practice a few new array methods

#### What did I learn?
  * `.some()` will check to see if at least one thing in the array has what you are looking for
* using curlies around the variable name will print the variable name in the console with its value
* can get the current year from the Date function using this syntax: `const currentYear = (new Date()).getFullYear()`
* `.every()` returns a Boolean based on the result of a specified condition; all array elements must pass the test to return `true`
* `findIndex()` returns the first element in an array that satisfies the provided testing function
