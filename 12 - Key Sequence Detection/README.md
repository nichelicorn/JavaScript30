<!-- [Video time!](https://codepen.io/nichelicorn/pen/RwgJMjJ) -->

#### Goals
* When someone inputs a certain sequence of keys, an action will be performed
* Inspired by Konami's up+up+down+down...

#### What did I learn?
* Can set a "secret code" that can be listened for to invoke a function
* Cornify.js is a library to add unicorn splashes to a page
