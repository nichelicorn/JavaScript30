# JavaScript30 no. 12 - Key Sequence Detection

[Crack the code!](https://codepen.io/nichelicorn/pen/abwXzjv)

#### Goals
* When a user inputs a certain sequence of keys, an action will be performed
* Inspired by Konami's up+up+down+down...

#### What did I learn?
* Can set a "secret code" that can be listened for to invoke a function
* Cornify.js is an old library to add unicorn splashes to a page
* Reviewed `Element.classList` on MDN
* Reviewed articles on CSS-Tricks
