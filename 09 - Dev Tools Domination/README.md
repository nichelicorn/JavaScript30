Learn more about the dev tools!

[Dev Tool Dom ðŸ› ](https://codepen.io/nichelicorn/pen/wveyxdK)

#### Goals
* Learn more about the dev tools in the browser
* Create tool to display console action in the window
  * This is in progress! It seems a more difficult challenge than I expected it to be. Will need further thought to build this tool.

#### What did I learn?
* Can set a break point using the Inspector to view actions in the code :  inspect the element before action, right click > Break on > Attribute Modification
* You can set styles in the console. Neat!
* There is a lot more to do in the console than just check single errors / debugging
