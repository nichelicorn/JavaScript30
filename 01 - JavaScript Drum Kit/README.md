# SynthPad

A vanilla JavaScript project, inspired by Wes Bos' #JavaScript30 course.

### What did I learn on this one?
* the `event.keyCode` attribute can be used to determine which key is being pressed
* the `KeyboardEvent.keyCode` feature is no longer recommended by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode)
* audio files can be [embedded in the HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) to be used in scripts
* the `<audio>` element also provides built-in methods that can be called, ex. `audio.play()` can be included in scripts to start play on a selected audio file
