      <p class="ital">If  I am black and beautiful, I really am and I know it and I don’t care who cares or says what. —Nina Simone</p>
      <br>
      <p class="poem">No bitter peach or stranger fruit <br>
        grafted to a noble tree, <br>
        she takes her place in lineage</p>
      <p class="poem">areola diversity, oracular <br>
        who looks to see, edges of a baby’s ear, <br>
        that child’s cuticles</p>
      <p class="poem">in line though long shot to a throne. <br>
        How dark might she be? <br>
        How dark becomes her loveliness!</p>
      <p class="poem">A newborn beauty in the world <br>
        old as being human.<br>
        Her own indivisible soul—</p>
      <p class="poem">the brine’s—the duct’s—bumps in air’s chill. <br> 
        Liquid wafts under <br> 
        the corpuscle’s depth, hue</p>
      <p class="poem">not one drop dilution or taint. <br>
        Showing all her colors, still too soon <br>
        to know how history hurts.</p>
      <p class="poem">A black wail is a killer, puller into deep <br>
        half moon occludes an area <br>
        waves fan out sonic <span class="ital">chuch</span></p>
      <p class="poem">a smooth meadow rose is as black as the beach <br>
        plum, black huckleberry is black huckleberry, blue <br>
        berry is also black, a black broadest in the middle.</p>
      <p class="poem">What else prompts imagining of her? <br>
      Bubble lineation here, here, <br>
      from oxygenature on down</p>
      <p class="poem">above, glory as corkscrew: iron-like humor, <br>
      inﬁnite symbols conversant toward heave, <br>
      athwart deﬁled gravitation </p>
      <p class="poem">hotcomb hero hooﬁn it <br>
      hominy harbor unbothered <br>
      guayabera grill guise </p>
      <p class="poem">rockin that radiator rah rah <br>
      shakin that shortcake shekere <br>
      mic check missy, a miracle </p>
      <p class="poem">coloratura marrow, true voice on the blackhand side <br>
      how we can “tell” beyond inﬂection points, <br>
      a throat’s tinge </p>
      <p class="poem">skeletal black, muscular black, breathing <br>
      from a black organ, black time passes behind <br>
      the black minute, other black dimensions </p>
      <p class="poem"> gohonzon gals harmonizing <br>
      scriptured baby hairs scissoring <br>
      some bodies to believe in, some body to bleed </p>
      <p class="poem">peel off in black layers, limber and black at <br>
      ﬂowering time, the fear of black, not black <br>
      but black, bone-black, sudden-black </p>
