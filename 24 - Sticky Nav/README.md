#### Goals
* Set a sticky header on a page

#### What did I learn?
* When elements are fixed on the page, they no longer take up space in the DOM, but rather "float" above the other content
  * This can be addressed by programatically (in JavaScript) adding padding to the parent element that is equal to the offset height of the element being fixed
